### Introduction
---
This is an ML initiative aimed at developing a model that forecasts the outcome of matchups in the NCAAM tournament. The project began by filtering a Kaggle dataset to include only the top 64 teams based on ESPN’s BPI and scraping ESPN for game scores and outcomes from the 2024–25 season. The target variable was defined by whether team_1 won or lost, and 26 features were created by computing the differences between the statistics of the two competing teams. The data was then split into training/validation and test sets, with a StandardScaler applied to maintain uniformity, and class imbalance was addressed using class weight adjustments.

After evaluating several models—including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest—the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective, achieving consistent accuracy around 68% on both validation and test sets, with superior precision and competitive recall. Cross-validation further confirmed its robustness, while a baseline Dummy classifier underscored the improvements made. Feature importance analysis highlighted that BPI was the most critical predictor, followed by Net Rating and Adjusted Defensive Efficiency, validating the overall approach and reinforcing the Random Forest model as the optimal choice for forecasting NCAAM tournament outcomes.
